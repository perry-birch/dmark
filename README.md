[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/Vizidrix/dmark/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/Vizidrix/dmark/latest)

Goals:
- Simplify creating basic benchmarks
- Provide consistent results structure (first)
- Provide extendable results structure (later)
- Figure out how to enable publishing results to a server (ala Dart Performance)
- Compose suites of benchmarks
- Integrate with development/testing loop for performance related work
